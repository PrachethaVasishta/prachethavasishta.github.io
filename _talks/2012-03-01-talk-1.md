I participated in Inno Champ 2022, a national innovation contest conducted by Synopsys, Inc. on the theme **‘Building smart cities leading to a cleaner and healthier planet’.** 
After significant research, I proposed a solution involving an efficient network of interconnected Intelligent Autonomous transport systems using AI and IoT. This solution aimed at preventing accidents and congestion while significantly improving urban mobility and sustainability. 
The proposal was recognized for its innovation and potential impact, earning me the **runner-up position** out of all participants nationwide.
