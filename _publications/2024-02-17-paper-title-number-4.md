**Abstract**: This paper describes the need for a Multi-Valued Logic System (MVL), particularly with radix 3. Multi-valued logic refers to systems with more than two truth values or potential states. The paper details the design of ternary inverter, ternary NAND, and NOR gates, from which other gates are derived. The design of sequential circuits like SR Flip-Flop and D Flip-Flop is extended to ternary logic, offering numerous applications. Ternary logic surpasses binary in performance, connectivity, density, power consumption, and complexity by conserving chip area and facilitating error detection and correction. Simulations were conducted using LT-Spice software. This work compares ternary and binary logic, demonstrating that ternary systems can handle more data simultaneously.
