This project aims at detecting different types of faults that occur in a wireless sensor network using LSTM. It features a hardware setup comprising transmitters, receivers, sensors, and sensor nodes, with NodeMCU and Raspberry Pi as the central nodes. 

The software architecture includes:
- A central server with a MySQL database.
- A Python client that communicates with the hardware to collect sensor data and stores it in the database.
- An LSTM-based custom-built model that processes the data to detect faults.
- A user interface built with Node.js and Grafana to display results.

This solution is highly customizable and can be applied to a variety of use cases.
